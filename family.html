        <h1><font size="38">My Family</font></h1>
        <p>Family is a important part in someone's life. Call me cliche but family always come first. Some people's relationship with their family is not very good, espcially with their parents because parents hardly express their feelings and act tough in front of their children. Which causes the relationship between their child to lessen sometimes. In my case, my family, or my parents have a very deep bond with each other. We all communicate our feelings and thoughts with each other often. I'm close with my siblings and even closer to my parent. Sometimes my parent even share their problems with me regarding work or just generally about their day. We all always have dinner together when all of us are home. I love my family so much. Hence, I would like to introduce all of them below! </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Before that, I actually have a huge family tree, my father's side and my mother's. I'm actually quite close to both of the sides since we live not far from them. We frequently meet during special occasion so, my relationship with all of them is quite good i would say. Now, look at the table to see how big my family and relatives are. The table represent how many siblings my parent have and how many kids does each of them have.</p>
