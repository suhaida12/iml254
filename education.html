<p>Education is essential to the growth of the individual and the community. It gives people knowledge, the ability to think critically, and a comprehensive awareness of the world. The ability to access opportunities, enhance one's quality of life, and advance a community as a whole all depend on education. A more knowledgeable and enlightened society results from the promotion of social ideals, skill development, and intellectual growth. Education is a potent instrument for promoting equality, ending the cycle of poverty, and laying the groundwork for advancement and creativity. In the end, it is crucial in forming people and society in preparation for a better and more sustainable future. In this section I will show you where are the place or schools I get my education at. I have a lot of memories in these school and despite how hard the journey has been I will still be grateful for having a place that has taugh me a lot about life</p>

<p>Let's start with my primary school. I went to this school which is Sekolah Kebangsaan Bagan Jermal (SKBJ). It's located at Butterworth, Penang. This school is the nearest school to my house which only requires me to walk about 7 minutes to go there. It is very convinent because when I was younger, my parent usually went to work early so, my siblings and I can walk to school together along with my grandma. This is the only primary school I go to. I started going to this school since I was 6 years old until I'm 12 years old. I have a lot of memories at this school, most of them are good memories. I used to have a lot of friends at that time and we usually spend most of the time together. Especially when I was 12. During the UPSR season we had A LOT of extra classes and tuitions until 12am so, my class was like a family to me. Everything was worth it in my opinion, I was an average student and never really got A's in most subject. The only subject that I'm good at was Mathematics. I used to love mathematics cause it was easy back then hahaha but when I was 12, the teachers did all they could to improve each of our results and in the end I finally able to scored straight A's for my UPSR. Hence, it became the school that I treasures the most. I miss my childhood when everything was so much easier </p>

<p> My high school. This is where things started going down to be honest. Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Dato' Onn (SMKDOB). It's located at Bagan Ajam. At first I was excited to enroll in this school because it was one of the best school around my house area at THAT time because you need to have at least 3 or 4A's to be a student there. Before you could become the official student you need to take tests too so that they can determine which class you belongs to. I used to take German language because my freind forced me to but turned out she failed the exam and I passed. So, I got to be in the first class where we studies German language and she had to be in different class. I did not mind it too much because I got to meet a lot of kind people there. My classmates when I was in form 1 until form 3 are the same people so, we naturally became close like a family. I was close to all of my classmates cause they all communicate with each other equally. There were Chinese and Indians in my class so it felt comfortable. That was until I'm in form 4. Form 4 was a disaster because the people there are not friendly at all. They have their own group and I got hospitalized too during that time which makes me hard to catch up. Some things happened and I decided to move to another school for the next year at that time. However, I did not deny that this school has give me a lot of experince to grow and I do have good memories here.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I moved school when I'm in my form 5 which when I was 17 years old. The new school that I went to is called Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Kampong Kastam (SMKKK) which is SO much closer to my house compared to the previous school. It was really convinent since I only need to walk to go there. This school used to have quite a reputation for their 'bad' students. A lot of my friends was schocked when they knew I moved there cause they thought the school is for 'bad' students. To be honest the enviroment there is so much better than SMKDOB. All of the rumors or asumptions that people had was not true at that time. Time changes and people still have that kind of mindset where some of the students are bad which makes the school bad. I had a great time when I was at the school though. Most of the students in SMKKK are chinese and indians, there are not much Malays but my classmates all treat me well. Whether they are chinese or indians we all talked and helped each other. My experience at new school is so much better compared to what i experinced when I'm in my form 4. The teachers here also are very kind and have high expectations for me which I do not mind much. I was close with the teachers there. Overall, my SPM result was not excellent but it was expected and I was content with what I got.</p>

<br>   
<p> After I'm done with SPM, I decided to persue my students as a Form 6 student in Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Teluk Air Tawar (SMKTAT). I did get some offer to pursue my studies at other place but I was not interested. Form 6 was alright, I met lots of new friends but oh dear it sure is hard. I'm not sure if it's just me but the pressure that I got when I'm in form 6 was so bad, I was really thankful when my parent allow me to quit. I do think about it sometimes on how I should be doing my degree right now but I did not regret my decision. I know past me would be proud of me now for putting myself first. As long as I did not lose hope it'll definitely be alright in the end, InshaAllah. </p>
